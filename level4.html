        Imagine that we have Tailwind installed in our project.
        - ->
        <h1 class="bg-gray-300 text-red-400">
            <!-- This is a heading 1 with Tailwind CSS classes applied -->
        <!-- bg-gray-300: Sets the background color of the h1 to light gray -->
        <!-- text-red-400: Sets the text color of the h1 to red -->
            is this different from the h1 in level 3, if so, how is it different?</h1>
